# Randomizer

An app that does nothing more than randomly select left or right.

## Features

### 1. Lightweight
It's only 100kb with the jQuery.

### 2. Web-based
It's made with HTML, CSS and JavaScipt(jQuery) so it can run on any devices with web-browser.

### 3. Customizable
I just provide the function, you can customize the CSS and JS files to make this app looks and works better.

### 4. Free
Why spent millions if you can just download this app .zip file and upload it to your own server or convert it into mobile apps with some free tools on the internet?

Pssst, if you're confident enough or have god-like marketing skills, you can rebrand this app and sell it for US$1.4M
